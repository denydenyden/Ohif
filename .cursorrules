# OHIF Viewer Project Rules

## Project Overview

OHIF (Open Health Imaging Foundation) Viewer - web-based medical imaging viewer for DICOM images.
Monorepo structure managed with Lerna and Yarn Workspaces.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+, Yarn 1.20.0+
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Build**: Webpack (dev), Rsbuild (experimental fast mode)
- **Medical Imaging**: Cornerstone3D for 2D/3D rendering
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with extensions and modes system

## Project Structure

```
platform/     - Core platform (app, core, ui, ui-next, i18n, cli)
extensions/   - Feature extensions (cornerstone, dicom-*, measurement-tracking, etc.)
modes/        - Workflow modes (basic, longitudinal, segmentation, etc.)
```

## Development Setup

- **Mac Apple Silicon**: Use `caffeinate -i yarn run dev` for performance cores
- **Ubuntu Server**: Standard `yarn run build` for production
- Always use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` for security
- Enable Yarn Workspaces: `yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`

## Key Commands

- `yarn run dev` - Development server (localhost:3000)
- `yarn run dev:fast` - Fast dev mode (rsbuild)
- `yarn run build` - Production build
- `yarn run test:unit` - Run tests

## Code Style

- TypeScript/JavaScript with React
- Follow existing code patterns in extensions and modes
- Use extension system for new features
- Maintain PWA compatibility

## Important Context

- This is a "dumb client" - no data storage, only configuration
- Works with DICOMweb-compatible image archives
- Highly configurable and extensible via extension system
- Supports multiple workflow modes

## Auto-Update Rules

**IMPORTANT**: After completing significant changes, update this file with:

1. New features or extensions added
2. Configuration changes
3. Build/deployment process updates
4. Important architectural decisions
5. Dependencies or tooling changes

Keep entries brief and focused on what matters for future context.
